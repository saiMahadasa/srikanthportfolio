<p className = 'instname'><i class="fas fa-circle"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CS India & Network Programs</p>
                            <p className = 'work-desc'>In Q3 2020, amidst COVID-19's second wave, I developed a SharePoint-based, VBA-integrated solution for real-time tracking of
associate illness, addressing shrinkage and SLA challenges, providing CP teams with accurate forecasts, and HRBPs with vital
support data, while regularly updating senior leadership.
</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'>From 2019 to 2022, I played a pivotal role in the CS India Attrition team, comprising Senior Site Leaders, Operational Leaders,
HRBPs, and Program Managers. Our aim was to analyze and mitigate the attrition of L2 & L3 CSAs. My responsibilities included
developing strategies to lower attrition rates and providing detailed insights on various cohorts on a weekly, monthly, and yearly
basis. I created and refined the Early Warning System (EWS) program, which accurately forecasted potential attritions. Through
these initiatives, we saw a significant reduction in annualized attrition rates: a 1694 bps improvement in 2020 compared to 2019,
and a 2666 bps improvement compared to 2018. In 2022, the attrition rate further improved to 43.25%. Additionally, I led
informative sessions on EWS, reducing the turnaround time for retention discussions from 8.8 to 3 business days, thereby saving
427 employees. My consistent contributions led to my appointment in formulating tailored goals for all CS India sites for 2021 and
2022.

</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'>• Team Follow-up’ was formed to increase follow-up adoption% & reduce missed follow-ups at CS India. I was responsible for
creating a framework and mechanism to increase follow up adoption%. I structured the follow up SOP that at granular level and
updated in Knowledge Center of CSC tool (unified tool used by ~60K CSA Worldwide) and developed in house automated reporting
framework which is being shared with all the 33 sites operating out of India. This resulted in a missed follow-up reduction of 650
bps QoQ. The automation is now absorbed in Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.com WW CS Sites (2020 – 2022)

</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'>Have been the single point of contact for the Director escalations for RD approvals. In the year 2020 – 21 we have processed
~3.3K Director RD escalation which involves multiple stakeholders and accounting. Along with this our team has also processed
52K exception RD’s which is only being followed in India. Along with this for 2021 & H1 2022 REG team did 235 bps and 451 bps
favorable to Planned OP2 goals.
</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'> In 2021, tt.amazon was phased out, necessitating a transition to the Decider platform. As the REG skill at our network
processed the highest volume of weekly tickets, I identified gaps in the Decider tool migration during this shift. Collaborating
with global tech teams, I resolved key issues, ensuring a seamless migration without impacting production. (2021)
</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'> Following the shift to remote work post-COVID-19, our four physical locations faced challenges in productivity and compliance. I
spearheaded the KPI Outlier Governance team, tasked with creating a dashboard to monitor 12 key performance indicators,
identifying deviations, and guiding a team to address these variances. We conducted weekly reviews with senior leadership,
highlighting accomplishments and improvement areas. This initiative proved highly effective and was subsequently
implemented across all CS India domains (2020 – 2022).
</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'>  I developed a metric called (LPH) Loss of Production Hours due to self-Delayed & Office transport late logins across all sites in in
India. This helped in reducing loss in production hours from which helped in safeguarding SL’s during shift changes. The process
was initially launched as a pilot in HYD and later expanded to CS India. This resulted in an increase of 15 min production per CSA
(~32K Employees in CS India). 
</p>
<p className = 'work-desc'> After shifting to a Work from Home model, I identified and addressed regular PTL gaps at B&M sites impacting SLA. Through a
custom SQL query, I discovered unrecognized default aux usage by CSAs. To counter this, I created a new metric, "Missed
Default Time (MDT)," and established corresponding reports and mechanisms. Piloted in HYD, MDT improved to 12 minutes per
CSA in Q2 2021, a significant improvement from 38 minutes in Q3 2020. This metric has since been integrated into the
scorecards of all CSAs operating in Amazon India.
